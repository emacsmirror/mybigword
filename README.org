* mybigword
Use Zipf frequency of each word to extract English big words.

The words whose Zipf frequency less than =mybigword-upper-limit= are big words.

Zipf scale was proposed by Marc Brysbaert, who created the SUBTLEX lists.
Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it
appears per billion words.

A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words,for example, and a
word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.

Reasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but the minimum Zipf value appearing
here is 1.0.

We use 0 as the default Zipf value for words that do not appear in the given words.
although it should mean one occurrence per billion words."

Thanks to https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq for providing the data.

* Install
Place =mybigword.el= and =eng.zipf= under Load Path. Then add =(require 'mybigword)= to your configuration.
* Usage
Run =mybigword-show-big-words-from-file= or =mybigword-show-big-words-from-current-buffer=.
